Virtual Monitoring Framework

This project is designed to create a framework which intends to reduce the gap that comes between receiving education and applying it.
Virtual Monitoring Framework intends to update the education system through progressive analysis of students by pointing out their strengths and weaknesses, and give necessary suggestions so that education does not become a burden for the them. 
The students of the age group 4 years till 10 years will be subjected to an annual psychometric assessment as part of their yearly syllabus. the results will be published to both parents as well as the school management, plus a copy would be kept with the system. Suggestions would be given based on previous performance.
The progress can be monitored and can help the students to work out on the grey areas. The parents will also have a proper report and analysis of their child's strengths and weaknesses, so that they are not pushed towards a  particular career path. 

We believe that every student in unique and immensely talented. It's just the matter of finding them. And that is exactly what we aim to do. To bring out the best performance in every child, and hence we have decided to call our test as 'JoyfullLearning' as we want to inculcate the habit of looking forward to exams and tests, rather than dreading it.
Utilizing artificial intelligence and natural language processing for customised output for each student. 

Apart from that our method of analysis will be based on the 'Wechsler Scale Fourth Edition' which is primarily based on doing psychometric analysis on children ranging from 6 year old to 16 year old. All these tests will be taken after consulting with child psychologists and educators. The present report however is only based on the following research papers:
1. 
2. 
3. 

These tests will primarily cover three performance models:
  1. Memory based tests
  2. Perception based tests
  3. Communication based tests
Each student will be given a set of questions from each model, which would be based on the application or utilization of the curriculum taught in school. The performance will be measured based on the right answer or wrong answer. 
Apart from that we will be taking a general personality / habit test which would then be correlated with the answers from performance models. Based on that a wholesome report will be generated and provided as a result. These tests have no winners or failures. They only help in recommending the learning stage of the child and what can be done to improve it.
